# glow_bytecode
glow bytecode specification, assembler and disassembler

## goals of this project
This Project consists of an interpreter for Glow bytecode.

Glow bytecode is an intermediate format between a high-level programming language and
low level machine instructions. It will hopefully be used heavily in the future for
compiling and distributing programs written in a programming language currently in design.
